# car-parking-system
Main aim of developing this car parking system is to record online all the information about the cars in the parking. If a car leaves the parking, it will be recorded online instead being recorded in the papers. Now-a-days, the car parking companies have more number of cars in order to increase their business in this competing environment. It is not an easy job to maintain the list of cars in papers and it is not very secure. Our project would be very useful to maintain the of cars in parking.
