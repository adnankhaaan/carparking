Main aim of developing this car rental system is to record online all the information about the cars in the garage. If a car leaves the garage, it will be recorded online instead being recorded in the papers. Now-a-days, the car rental companies have more number of cars in order to increase their business in this competing environment. It is not an easy job to maintain the list of cars in papers and it is not very secure. Our project would be very useful to maintain the of cars in parking.
